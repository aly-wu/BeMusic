## External Libraries:

If you are using external libraries, place the .jar files in a /lib folder and also commit them. Check out the Project Manager for Java VSCode extension to be able to import their classes and methods. If any external libraries need to be installed beyond their .jar files, please detail how to do so in the README.

We used the SpotifyAPI to take our users song history and get deatils from Spotify, such as track title, artist(s), url to the track's album cover, and the track's "popularity score", which is a Spotify-made score from 0 (not popular) to 100 (very popular).

The OpenCSV library is used to simplfy parsing in data from listening_data.csv to populate our users and their listening histories.

Apache NetBeans is used to format and display the GUI.

These APIs and libraries are managed through the pom.xml file that keeps track of dependencies.

## Use Instructions:

Instructions on how to call your public methods. That is, you are now writing an API in your README. This could be the same thing as your JavaDocs: What is the method called? What are its inputs and outputs? What is a verbal description of what it does? Don’t forget about constructors!

For each of your public methods, also include usage examples. What do expected inputs and outputs look like in practice? For example, a usage example for add(x,y) would be add(2, 3) = 5.
